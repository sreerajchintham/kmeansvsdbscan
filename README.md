# `kmeansvsdbscan.ipynb` - Apartment Clustering Analysis

## 📄 Brief Description

This Google Colab notebook conducts a comparative analysis of K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to segment a dataset of apartment rental listings. It aims to identify natural groupings of apartments based on their geographical location, price, and square footage, providing insights into market segments and property distributions.

## 🚀 Overview

The notebook explores unsupervised learning techniques to discover patterns within apartment rental data. It demonstrates the entire machine learning pipeline, from data loading and cleaning to model application, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and performance evaluation. By comparing K-Means (a centroid-based algorithm) and DBSCAN (a density-based algorithm), the analysis highlights their respective strengths in identifying different types of clusters and handling noise in real-world geospatial data.

## ✨ Key Features and Functionality

*   **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales numerical features (`latitude`, `longitude`, `price`, `square_feet`).
*   **K-Means Clustering**:
    *   Applies K-Means with different `k` values.
    *   Utilizes the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine an optimal number of clusters.
    *   Analyzes cluster characteristics (mean price, square feet) and assigns broad geographical regions to clusters.
    *   Visualizes clusters on static scatter plots and interactive Folium maps.
*   **DBSCAN Clustering**:
    *   Focuses on geospatial data (`latitude`, `longitude`).
    *   Employs the K-distance graph method to assist in determining optimal `eps` (epsilon) parameter.
    *   Identifies dense clusters and noise points (outliers).
    *   Visualizes DBSCAN clusters on static scatter plots and interactive Folium maps.
*   **Cluster Evaluation**: Compares K-Means and DBSCAN using standard metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Score.
*   **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates dynamic and explorable maps using `folium` to visually represent the clustering results.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used

The notebook leverages the following Python libraries:

*   **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
*   **Visualization**: `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `folium`, `folium.plugins.MarkerCluster`
*   **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)**:
    *   `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` (for feature scaling)
    *   `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` (for K-Means clustering)
    *   `sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN` (for DBSCAN clustering)
    *   `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` (for DBSCAN parameter tuning)
    *   `sklearn.metrics` (for cluster evaluation: `silhouette_score`, `davies_bouldin_score`, `calinski_harabasz_score`)
    *   `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` (imported but not explicitly used in the provided notebook content)
*   **Jupyter/Colab Utilities**: `IPython.display.IFrame`

## 📊 Main Sections and Steps

The analysis unfolds through the following key stages:

1.  **Setup and Data Loading**: Imports all necessary libraries and loads the apartment rental dataset (`apartments_for_rent_classified_10K 2.csv`).
2.  **Initial Data Exploration**: Displays basic DataFrame information (`head()`, `shape`, `isna().sum()`) and uses `seaborn.pairplot` for initial visual inspection.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: Selects `latitude`, `longitude`, `price`, and `square_feet` features, drops rows with missing values in these columns, and standardizes them using `StandardScaler`.
4.  **K-Means Clustering Implementation**:
    *   Performs initial K-Means runs with `k=5` and `k=8`, visualizing the results.
    *   **Optimal `k` Determination**: Calculates and plots inertia (Elbow Method) and Silhouette scores for `k` from 2 to 10 to suggest an optimal number of clusters (which points to `k=5`).
    *   **Detailed K-Means Analysis**: Re-applies K-Means with `k=5`, summarizes the clusters' price and square footage statistics, assigns broad geographical regions (e.g., "West Coast", "Northeast") to clusters, and visualizes mean price/size per cluster.
    *   **Interactive K-Means Map**: Generates an interactive Folium map, color-coding apartments by their K-Means cluster and providing pop-up details.
5.  **DBSCAN Clustering Implementation**:
    *   Focuses solely on `latitude` and `longitude` for DBSCAN.
    *   **Parameter Tuning**: Plots the K-distance graph (for the 10th nearest neighbor) to help determine a suitable `eps` value.
    *   **DBSCAN Application**: Runs DBSCAN with `eps=0.2` and `min_samples=10`, identifying clusters and noise points.
    *   **Visualizing DBSCAN Clusters**: Plots clusters on a static scatter plot and generates an interactive Folium map.
6.  **Model Evaluation and Comparison**:
    *   Calculates Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Score for both K-Means (on scaled 4D data) and DBSCAN (on 2D geospatial data, excluding noise).
    *   Presents these comparison metrics in a clear DataFrame.
7.  **Further DBSCAN Cluster Analysis (Partial)**: (Notebook content truncated for this section, but it suggests further characterization of DBSCAN clusters similar to K-Means, potentially including price, square feet, and regional analysis for identified clusters.)

## 📈 Key Insights and Results

*   **Data Cleaning Importance**: The initial data exploration revealed the necessity of handling missing values to ensure the quality of clustering.
*   **K-Means Effectiveness**: K-Means effectively partitions the dataset into a predefined number of `k` clusters. For `k=5`, it groups apartments into distinct segments that often align with major U.S. geographical regions, exhibiting clear differences in average price and square footage. This provides a high-level view of market segments.
*   **DBSCAN for Density & Outliers**: DBSCAN excels at finding arbitrarily shaped, dense clusters based purely on geographical proximity. It also successfully identifies noise points, which are data points that do not belong to any dense region. This is particularly useful for identifying highly localized markets or anomalies.
*   **Algorithm Suitability**:
    *   **K-Means** is better suited for global market segmentation where you want to group properties into a fixed number of segments based on multiple features.
    *   **DBSCAN** is ideal for identifying natural, geographically dense areas and pinpointing outliers, making it useful for hyper-local analysis or fraud detection.
*   **Evaluation Metrics**: The evaluation metrics (Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Calinski-Harabasz) provide quantitative insights into cluster quality, though their interpretation should consider the distinct nature of each algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN producing many small clusters vs. K-Means producing fewer, larger ones).

## 🚀 How to Use/Run the Notebook

This notebook is designed to be run in Google Colaboratory.

1.  **Open in Google Colab**:
    *   Upload the `kmeansvsdbscan.ipynb` file directly to Google Colab.
2.  **Dataset Requirement**:
    *   The notebook requires a CSV file named `apartments_for_rent_classified_10K 2.csv`.
    *   **Upload this file to your Colab environment**. You can typically do this by clicking the "Files" icon on the left sidebar, then "Upload to session storage," and selecting your CSV file. Ensure it's placed in the default `/content/` directory.
    *   The notebook expects the file to be delimited by semicolons (`;`) and encoded with `cp1252` or `ISO-8859-1`.
3.  **Run All Cells**:
    *   Once the notebook and dataset are loaded, navigate to `Runtime` -> `Run all` in the Colab menu.
    *   The notebook will execute all cells sequentially, performing the analysis and generating plots.
4.  **Interactive Maps**:
    *   The `folium` maps will be saved as HTML files (e.g., `/tmp/kmeans_cluster_map.html`, `/tmp/dbscan_cluster_map.html`) and then embedded directly within the Colab output using `IPython.display.IFrame`. You can interact with these maps directly in the notebook output cells.
    *   If you wish to view the maps in a separate browser tab, you can download the `.html` files from the `/tmp/` directory in your Colab files panel after the cells have run.
